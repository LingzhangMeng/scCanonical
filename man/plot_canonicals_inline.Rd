\title{Plot Canonical Markers for Clusters in a Single Row}
\usage{
plot_canonicals_inline(cons_joined, canonical, custom_colors)
}
\arguments{
\item{cons_joined}{A data frame containing differential expression results for
all genes, with columns \code{delta_pct}, \code{spec_score}, and \code{cluster}.}

\item{canonical}{A data frame containing canonical marker genes, with columns
\code{delta_pct}, \code{spec_score}, \code{gene}, and \code{cluster}.}

\item{custom_colors}{A named vector of colors for each cluster, used for
coloring points and labels in the plot.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object representing the faceted scatter plot of canonical
markers, with all facets in a single row and fixed x-axis labels. The plot is
also printed to the active graphics device.
}
\description{
This function generates a faceted scatter plot of canonical markers for each
cluster, with all facets arranged in a single row. The plot displays the
difference in expression percentage (\code{delta_pct}) on the x-axis and specificity
score (\code{spec_score}) on the y-axis. Canonical markers are highlighted with
distinct colors and labeled, while non-canonical markers are shown in the
background.
}
\details{
The function creates a scatter plot using \code{ggplot2}, with background points for
all genes in \code{cons_joined} and highlighted points for canonical markers in
\code{canonical}. Points are colored by cluster, and gene labels are added for
canonical markers using \code{geom_text_repel} to avoid overlap. The plot is faceted
by cluster in a single row with free y-axis scales. The x-axis is fixed with
breaks at 0, 0.5, and 1, and limits from 0 to 1. Custom y-axis breaks are
calculated for each cluster, and a "-" marker is added at the left border of
each facet panel to indicate these breaks. The plot uses a minimal theme with
customized aesthetics for clarity and readability.
